      	<h2>Tutorial: Securing an Unmanned Ground Vehicle</h2>
      	<p>
      	In this tutorial, we are going to use Imhotep-SMT in order to secure the operation
      	of controlling an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) against sensor attacks. The UGV
      	has two states: position $x(t)$ and velocity $v(t)$. A model for the time evolution 
      	of these states can be derived using conservation of energy laws as follows:
      	\begin{equation*}
      		\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{v} \end{bmatrix}
      			= \begin{bmatrix}0    & 1\\0   & \frac{-B}{M} \end{bmatrix} 
      			\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ v(t) \end{bmatrix} + 
      			\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{M}\end{bmatrix} F(t),
      	\end{equation*}
      	where $M$ and $B$ denote the mechanical mass and the translational friction
		coefficient while $F(t)$ is the force input to the UGV at time $t$. The UGV is
		equipped with a GPS sensor which measures its position and
		two motor encoders which measure the translational velocity.
		The resulting output equation is:
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{bmatrix} y_{\text{GPS}}(t) \\ y_{\text{right encoder}}(t) \\ y_{\text{left encoder}}(t) \end{bmatrix} = 
			\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ v(t) \end{bmatrix}
			+
			\begin{bmatrix}\psi_{\text{GPS}}(t) \\ \psi_{\text{right encoder}}(t) \\ \psi_{\text{left encoder}}(t)\end{bmatrix},
		\end{equation*}
		where $\psi$ is the measurement noise on each sensor. These sensor measurements are used
		to estimate the states of the UGV. However, an adversarial attacker is 
		manipulating one of the UGV sensors in order to deceive the state estimator. In 
		the remaining of this tutorial, we will show how Imhotep-SMT can be used to detect 
		the existence of such an attacker while estimating the states of the UGV.

        <h2>Step 0-Download Imhotep-SMT</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
        	<li> Download the latest version of Imhotep-SMT from 
        <a href="https://github.com/nesl/Imhotep-smt/releases"> github </a>.  </li>
        	<li> After downloading the zip file, extract its contents to "folder_path/ImhotepSMT".</li>
        	<li> Open your Matlab, add "folder_path/ImhotepSMT/" to the Matlab path
        	 (File->Set path->Add folder).</li>
        </ul>
        
        
    	</p>
    	
        <br />
        
        <h2>Step 1-Initialize the SMT solver</h2>
        <p>
        	On the Matlab terminal, create a new instance of the Imhotep-SMT solver as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">smt = ImhotepSMT();</pre>
		</div>
		
		
		
        <br />
        
        <h2>Step 2-[Offline] Configure the SMT solver</h2>
		<p>
			The second step is to, offline, configure the SMT solver. This is done by specifying:
			<ol>
        		<li> A discrete-time mathematical model specifying how the states evolves over time as well as how 
        		the sensors measurements are related to the system states.</li>
        		<li> The maximum number of sensors that can be under attack.</li>
        		<li> [optional] A set of sensors which is known to be attack-free.</li>        		
        		<li> The upper bound on the measurement noise.</li>
        	</ol>
        </p>
        <p>	
        <b> 1- Discrete-time mathematical model:</b>
		Since our solver
		accepts only models in discrete-time, we start by discretizing the UGV model. 
		For $M = 0.8$ and $B = 1$ and sampling time $T_s = 100 ms$, we get the following model:
      	
      	\begin{equation*}
      		\begin{bmatrix} x(t+1) \\ v(t+1) \end{bmatrix}
      			= \begin{bmatrix}1.0000    & 0.0099\\0   & 0.9876 \end{bmatrix} 
      			\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ v(t) \end{bmatrix} + 
      			\begin{bmatrix} 0.0001 \\ 0.0124\end{bmatrix} F(t)
      	\end{equation*}
		 which can be declared inside the Matlab as:
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">A = [1 0.0099; 0 0.9876];
B = [0.0001; 0.0124];
C = [1 1; 0 1; 0 1];
ugv = ss(A,B,C,0,0.001);</pre>
		</div>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b> 2- Maximum number of sensors that can be under attack:</b>
		As discussed in the introduction, we know that the attacker can attack only one sensor.
		This can be specified as follows:
		<div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">max_sensors_under_attack = 1;</pre>
		</div>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b> 3- [optional] A set of safe sensors:</b>
		We initially assume that the attacker can attack any of the three sensors. We will 
		discuss later how Imhotep-SMT identify which sensors MUST be secured for such that
		the UGV can operate safely.
		
		<div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">safe_sensors = [];</pre>
		</div>
		</p>
		
		
		
        
        <p>
		<b> 4- The upper bound on the measurement noise:</b>
		Each sensor always suffers from measurement noise. The bound on the sensor measurement 
		noise is an important parameter which affects the security of the system. For this
		example, we assume all sensors are ideal and does not suffer from noise as follows:
		<div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">noise_bound = [0; 0; 0];</pre>
		</div>
		</p>
        
        <p>
        Finally, we can now initialize the SMT solver using the init() method as:
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">smt.init(sys, max_sensors_under_attack, safe_sensors, noise_bound);</pre>
		</div>
        </p>
        <p>
        The Imhotep-SMT creates a report for which it checks the security index of the
        given system and checks if it matches the specified number of sensors under attack.
        In this case, the following report is generated:
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeoutput">Theoretical upper bound on maximum number of attacks is: 0
Sensors that can improve system security are: Sensor#1 
 
ERROR: System structure does not match the specified maximum number of attacked sensors
Maximum number of attacked sensors must be less than 0</pre>
		</div>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	The generated report insures that the specified system can not tolerate any attacks
        	on its sensors. In other words, the internal structure of the system gives the
        	opportunity for the attaker to corruption the sensor measurements that preclude
        	ANY security algorithm from detecting which sensor is under attack. Moreover,
        	the analysis done by the Imhotep-SMT shows a potential increase in the 
        	security level of the system if the operator can insure that the GPS signal
        	is not attacked. In which case, we can re-define the set of safe sensors as:
        	<div class="content">
        	<pre class="codeinput">safe_sensors = [1];</pre>
			</div>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        And then re-initialize the solver again.
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">smt.init(sys, max_sensors_under_attack, safe_sensors, noise_bound);</pre>
        <pre class="codeoutput">Theoretical upper bound on maximum number of attacks is: 2
 
Disclaimer: Correction of the solver outputs is guaranteed if and only if
the specified system is observable after removing all combinations of 2 unsafe sensors.
To run this combinatorial test, call the checkObservabilityCondition()</pre>
		</div>
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    	The final step is check the sparse observability condition. This is the necessary
    	and sufficient condition to guarantee the correctness of the results. Depending
    	on the structure of the system, the test may take some time. Therefore, this test
    	runs through a separate API. This step can be skipped if the user knows that 
    	the sparse observability condition holds for the specified system.
    	<div class="content">
        <pre class="codeinput">smt.checkObservabilityCondition(1E-20);</pre>
        <pre class="codeoutput">Calculating lower bound on the number of sensors that can be attacked...
lower bound is euqal to 0
 
 
The specified "number of sensors under attack" lies between the theortical
upper and lower bounds ...
Checking the observability of 1 combinations ... This may take some time
 
Iteration number 1 out of 1 combinations ... PASS!
Sparse observability condition passed! Solver is ready to run!</pre>

    	</p>

        <h2>Step 2-[Online] Feed inputs, measure outputs, pass them to the solver</h2>
        <p>
        	Now with the solver is ready to run, we start feeding it the inputs and output signals
        	coming from the real system as shown in the figure below.
        	<br /><br /><br />
        	<img src="./images/Imhotep_SMT.png" alt="Imhotep-SMT" style="width:504px;height:328px">
        	<br />
        	Since the solver runs over Matlab, one needs to use Matlab capabilities embedded in
        	the "Real-time toolbox". For the purpose of this tutorial we are going
        	to use Matlab to simulate the dynamical system as follows.
        	<div class="content">
        	<pre class="codeinput">x0 = randn(2,1); %unknown initial condition
attacked_sensor_index = 2; % the attacker chooses to attack the second sensor.
for t = 1 : 1000	% simulate the system for 1000 time instances
    y   = C*x;		% the system measurements 
    % the attacker corrupts the second sensor with random data
    y(attacked_sensor_index) = y(attacked_sensor_index) + 50*randn(1); 
    
    F   = 1;		% the force supplied to the UGV
    x   = A*x + B*F;	% simulate the system
    
    [xhat, sensor_under_attack] = smt.addInputsOutputs(F, y);
    error = norm(xhat - x)
    sensor_under_attack
end</pre>
        	</div>
        </p>
        <p>
        Except for the first iteration, the code above will result into the following output 
        at each iteration of the simulation:
        <div class="content">
        <pre class="codeoutput">error =
     0
sensor_under_attack =
     2</pre>
		</div>
        </p>
        <p>
        In general, the first $n-1$ iterations (where $n$ is the number of states of the
        system), the output of the solver may be incorrect since the solver buffers does
        not have enough information to correctly compute the state and determine which sensors
        are under attack.
