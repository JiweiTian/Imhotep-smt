<hr>

<p>Estimation is a classical problem that arises naturally in statistics, signal processing and control of dynamical systems. In  this problem, a hidden state of a particular system is observed through a set of noisy measurements. Each noisy measurements observes part of the state. The objective of the estimation problem is to retrieve/reconstruct the hidden state out from these noisy measurements. </p>

<hr>

<p>With the current coupling between cyber components (e.g. microcontrollers) and physical systems, many attacking vectors is created that never existed before. In particular, an adversarial attacker can spoof/manipulate sensor readings such that the state of the system is incorrectly estimated. Incorrect estimation of the state can lead to catastrophic sequences. For example, in the following video, we show how incorrect estimation of the vehicle state can lead to loosing control of a vehicle.</p>

<hr>

<p>The secure estimation problem is NP-hard problem. Imhotep-SMT is a tool that can perform estimation of system's state from noisy measurements which is corrupted by an adversarial attack. The tool leverages ideas from literature of formal verification to the estimation world. </p>

<a id="who-is-imhotep" class="anchor" href="#who-is-imhotep" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is Imhotep:</h3>

<hr>

<p>Imhotep is an Egyptian poly mathematician, engineer and architect. He engineered the oldest pyramid that is know in history (named Sakara pyramid). He is considered the first author in history to write a manuscript on Mathematics.</p>
