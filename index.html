        <h2>Secure Cyber-Physical Systems:</h2>
        <p>
        Increased coupling between embedded computing technologies and modern control 
        systems has opened the door for developing many engineering systems with increasing 
        complexity. In such systems, commonly termed <i>cyber-physical systems</i> or CPS,
        information from the physical world is quantized and processed using digital electronic
    	components, and decisions taken by these "cyber components" are then applied 
    	to the physical world. 
    	</p>
    	
        <br />
        
        <p>
		Unfortunately, this tight coupling between cyber components 
    	and the physical world oftentimes leads to systems where increased sophistication 
    	comes at the expense of increased vulnerability and security weaknesses. 
    	 An important scenario is posed by a malicious adversary that can arbitrarily 
    	 corrupt the measurements of a subset of sensors in the system. These 
    	 sensor-related attacks can be deployed in any of the following components of a 
    	 real-life CPS:
        <ul> 
          <li><b>Software:</b>
          Malicious software running on the processor executing the sensor processing 
          routine can access the sensor information before it is processed by the controller
          itself. The Stuxnet malware is an infamous example of this category of attacks. 
          It exploits vulnerabilities in the operating system running over SCADA devices and
          once it obtains enough operating system privileges, it can corrupt the sensor 
          measurements collected via the attacked SCADA device
		  </li>
		  <br />
          <li><b>Network:</b>
          Modern control systems rely on a networked infrastructure to exchange sensor 
          information. Therefore, an adversarial attacker can corrupt sensor measurements
          by manipulating the data packets exchanged between various components, as has been 
          investigated, for instance, in smart grids.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li><b>Sensors Spoofing:</b>
          By tampering with the sensor hardware and/or environment, an adversary can mislead 
          the sensor about the value of the physical signal it is attempting to measure. 
          As previously shown by some researchers, it is possible to make drivers lose 
          control of their cars by directly spoofing the velocity sensors of anti-lock braking 
          systems in a non-invasive manner.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Imhotep-SMT: Secure State Estimator:</h2>
        <p>
        Imhotep-SMT is a novel Satisfiability-Modul-Theory solver that leverages results
        from formal methods and convex optimization techniques in order to detect, on 
        the real-time, if the sensor measurements collected from a dynamical system (e.g.
        robotic/automotive/aerospace vehicle, smart grid, industrial refinery, ...) is
        corrupted by an adversarial attack. So far, it can handle systems that can be 
        described by a linear dynamical model, and in a near future will also support
        some classes of nonlinear systems.
        </p>
        <br />
        
        <p>
        Imhotep-SMT is developed by a group of researchers at University of California at 
        Los Angeles and University of California at Berkeley.

        Note: Imhotep: (pronounced as "emmo-tepp") was an ancient Egyptian polymath
who is considered to be the earliest known architect, engineer and physician
in the early history. He is famous of the design of the oldest pyramid in Egypt;
Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara, Egypt, 2630 - 2611 BC.
