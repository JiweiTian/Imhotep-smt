        <h2>Secure Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>
        <p>
        The tight coupling between embedded computing and control 
        has opened the door to a variety of engineering systems of increasing 
        complexity. In such systems, often denoted as <i>Cyber-Physical Systems</i> (CPS),
        information from the "physical world" is quantized and processed by electronic
    	components, and decisions taken by these "cyber" components are applied back to 
    	the physical world. 
    	</p>
    	
        <br />
        
        <p>
		Unfortunately, this coupling between cyber and 
		physical components is leading to systems where increased sophistication 
    	comes at the expense of increased vulnerability and security weaknesses. 
    	 An important scenario is posed by a malicious adversary that can arbitrarily 
    	 corrupt the measurements of a subset of sensors in a system. These 
    	 sensor-related attacks can be deployed in any of the following components of a 
    	 real-life CPS:
        <ul> 
          <li><b>Software.</b>
          Malicious software running on the processor executing the sensor processing 
          routine can access the sensor information before it is processed by the controller
          itself. The Stuxnet malware is an infamous example of this category of attacks. 
          It exploits vulnerabilities in the operating system running over SCADA devices and
          once it obtains enough operating system privileges, it can corrupt the sensor 
          measurements collected via the attacked SCADA device.
		  </li>
		  <br />
          <li><b>Network.</b>
          Modern control systems rely on a networked infrastructure to exchange sensor 
          information. Therefore, an adversarial attacker can corrupt sensor measurements
          by manipulating the data packets exchanged between various components, as has been 
          investigated, for instance, in the context of smart electric power grids.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li><b>Sensors Spoofing.</b>
          By tampering with the sensor hardware or environment, an adversary can mislead 
          the sensor about the value of the physical signal it is attempting to measure. 
          It has been shown to be possible for drivers to lose 
          control of their cars by directly spoofing the velocity sensors of anti-lock braking 
          systems in a non-invasive manner.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Imhotep-SMT Secure State Estimator</h2>
        <p>
        Imhotep-SMT is a novel solver  that combines results
        from formal methods (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) and convex optimization to detect, in  
        real time, if a set of sensor measurements collected from a dynamical system is
        corrupted by an adversarial attack. Imhotep-SMT is being applied to secure state estimation 
        for several applications, e.g. robotic, automotive, and aerospace vehicles, smart grids, industrial refinery. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Imhotep-SMT currently supports systems that can be 
        described by a linear dynamical model. However, in a near future it will be extended to 
        some classes of nonlinear systems.
        </p>
        <br />
        
        <p>
        Imhotep-SMT is developed by a team of researchers at the University of California at 
        Los Angeles and the University of California at Berkeley.

        Note: Imhotep: (pronounced as "emmo-tepp") was an ancient Egyptian polymath
who is considered to be the earliest known architect, engineer and physician
in the ancient history. He is famous for the design of the oldest pyramid in Egypt, the 
Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara, Egypt, 2630 - 2611 BC.
